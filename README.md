Overview
For this project I created an online store<br>
My goal for this project was to create a website using Express, MongoDB, Node.js, and Handlebars.

How it works

There is a start and reset button.<br>
When pressed the start button will create the game board.<br>
The player then chooses a category and point value.<br>
Based on the user's selection a question and three multiple choice answers appear.<br>
If the user guesses the correct answer the point value will be added to their score.<br>
If the user does not guess the correct answer, then those points will be deducted from their score.<br>
The game ends when all questions are answered. They will win if their score is over 2000.<br>
